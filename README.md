# Smoker-Status-Detection-via-Bio-Signals

In this project, I attempt to unravel the intricate connections between biosignals and smoking status through the application of advanced machine learning models. Smoking remains a pervasive public health concern, contributing to a myriad of preventable diseases and impacting individuals and communities worldwide. Understanding the determinants of smoking behavior is crucial for the development of targeted interventions and public health strategies.

To achieve this, I leverage a diverse set of biosignal data, capturing physiological and behavioral markers, to build predictive models for smoking status. The primary objective is to discern patterns and correlations within the data that can elucidate the underlying factors influencing an individual's smoking habits. This involves the integration of cutting-edge machine learning techniques with comprehensive biosignal datasets.

The core datasets for this project include biosignal recordings, demographic information, and lifestyle data from a diverse cohort of individuals. By assimilating these datasets, the aim is to not only predict smoking status accurately, but also gain valuable insights into the complex interplay of variables contributing to smoking behavior.

To present the findings, there are comprehensive visualizations and interpretations, providing a transparent narrative of the analysis. Each visualization will be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the motivation behind the analysis, key takeaways, and the implications of our findings on our broader understanding of smoking behaviors.

I invite you to explore the depths of this project and engage with the knowledge uncovered. Your insights and questions will undoubtedly contribute to the refinement and enrichment of our understanding of the intricate dynamics that govern smoking habits, paving the way for more targeted and effective public health interventions.
